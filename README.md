# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
This repo provides 1D and 2D linear regression with gradient Descent scripts in python.

### What is gradient descent ?
It is an optimization algorithm to find the minimum of a function. We start with a random point on the function and move in the negative direction of the gradient of the function to reach the local/global minima.
